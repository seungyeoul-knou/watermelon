# Watermelon Next Step

Find a running task and resume execution from the current step — designed to absorb natural-language continuation intents ("이어서", "계속", "next", "proceed") without forcing the user to remember the slash command.

**Use `/bk-next`** when: there is at least one `running` task and the user wants to continue it.
**Use `/bk-start`** when: starting a new workflow, picking from multiple candidates, or resuming a **specific** task by ID (`/bk-start #123`).

## Core Principles

Shared with bk-start. Summary:

- Instructions are **internal directives** — never echo raw instruction text to the user. Show only results (analysis, questions, suggestions).
- Refer to steps as "step". Never expose "node", "node_type", etc.

## Natural Language Triggers

If the user says "proceed", "next", "continue", "let's go", "OK", "go ahead", "이어서", "계속" — treat it the same as `/bk-next`.

## Step 0 — Find the Active Task

<HARD-RULE>
Always resolve the task to resume before doing anything else.

1. Call `list_tasks(status=running)`.
2. If **exactly one** running task exists → use it directly.
3. If **multiple** running tasks exist → ask via AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "태스크 선택"
   - preview: list of tasks formatted as `"Task #{id} — {workflow_name} (Step {current_step}/{total_steps})"`
   - options: up to 4 task entries (most recent first)
4. If **no running tasks** → call `list_tasks(status=timed_out)` and check for timed-out tasks.
   - If found → ask: "이어서 진행할 태스크가 없습니다. 타임아웃된 태스크를 재개할까요?" (options: 가장 최근 재개 / 취소)
   - If none → tell the user "실행 중인 태스크가 없습니다. `/bk-start`로 새 워크플로를 시작하세요."

Once task_id is resolved, call `advance(task_id, peek=true)` to load the current step without advancing.
</HARD-RULE>

## Session Restore (Context Injection)

The `advance` response includes `task_context`. Use it to resume seamlessly in a new session.

1. `task_context.running_context` — Accumulated decisions and project state. Read and internalize it.
2. `task_context.completed_steps` — Summary of completed steps. Understand where we are.
3. `task_context.artifacts` — List of available artifacts. Use the Read tool on `file_path` entries when needed.
4. `task_context.last_session` — Last execution session info. Note if a different session/user progressed it.

When resuming in a new session (no prior conversation context), use `task_context` to reconstruct the situation before proceeding.

## execute_step Parameters

Same contract as bk-start. When calling `execute_step`:

**Always provide**:

- `context_snapshot` (object): decisions, key findings, next-step hints.
  Example: `{"decisions":[{"question":"tech stack","chosen":"Next.js","reason":"team experience"}],"key_findings":["RLS required"],"next_step_hint":"write implementation plan"}`
- `model_id` (string): current LLM model (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`, `gpt-5.2`). Read from system prompt.

**Provide when known**: `user_name`, `session_id`, `agent_id`.

**Do NOT send manually**: `provider_slug` — auto-injected by MCP handshake.

**Record file/commit/URL outputs** in the `artifacts` array on the same call:

- File created: `{artifact_type: "file", title: "Design Doc", file_path: "docs/specs/design.md"}`
- Git commit: `{artifact_type: "git_commit", title: "Phase 1 Implementation", git_ref: "<hash>"}`
- URL: `{artifact_type: "url", title: "PR", url: "https://..."}`

## Credential Handling

Same contract as bk-start: when `advance` returns a `credentials` field, use `credentials.secrets.<KEY>` as headers/params (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`). Never write raw secret values into `execute_step` output — only the call result (URL, status, response summary).

## Execution Loop

```
LOOP:
  1. If the current step is pending → extract response from conversation, save with execute_step
     → Check execute_step response for next_action field (see HITL section below)
  2. Call advance(peek=false) to fetch the next step
  3. If finished → call complete_task, then end
  4. Execute the next step (see step-type handling below)
  5. Check auto_advance:
     - true  → show brief inline result, then go back to step 2
     - false → HITL pause (see below)
```

<HARD-RULE>
After executing an auto_advance=true step, always proceed to the next step automatically.
Do not show "type /bk-next to continue" hint.
Show a brief one-line update: "✅ [{title}] done → continuing to next step..."
Repeat the loop until reaching an auto_advance=false step.
</HARD-RULE>

## HITL Pause (auto_advance=false steps)

<HARD-RULE>
When execute_step returns `next_action: "wait_for_human_approval"`:

1. Call `request_approval` with a brief message summarizing what was done.
2. Show the user:
   ```
   ⏸ Step [{title}] complete — waiting for approval before proceeding.
   A notification has been sent. Use /bk-approve when ready.
   ```
3. STOP. Do NOT call `advance`. Do NOT proceed to the next step.

The server will reject `advance` with 403 until a human approves via /bk-approve.
</HARD-RULE>

## Step-Type Handling

### action step

1. Read the instruction and execute it. Reference task context.
2. **Use heartbeat actively**: For tasks taking 30+ seconds, send heartbeat regularly.
   Example: "Analyzing architecture section...", "Designing API endpoints...", "Writing design doc line 119..."
3. Show the result to the user.
4. Save with `execute_step`.

### gate step

1. Check `get_web_response` for a web response first.
2. If none, ask naturally via `AskUserQuestion`.
3. **Partial edit option**: For approve/modify questions, offer 3 options: "Approve (Recommended)" / "Partial edit" / "Full rewrite".
4. Save the response with `execute_step`.

### loop step

1. Execute the instruction.
2. **Confirm before stopping**: When the stop condition is met, do not auto-stop — ask via AskUserQuestion:
   - "Enough information collected. Do you have anything else to add?"
   - "That's enough (Recommended)" / "I have more to add"
3. **Call execute_step once per loop iteration.** Do not merge multiple answers into one. Each iteration is a separate log entry.
4. Pass `loop_continue` true/false to execute_step.

## Progress Display

Show progress at the start of each step as a single line:

```
✅1 → ✅2 → ✅3 → **4** → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11
```

## When Pausing (auto_advance=false only)

- **HITL approval required** (execute_step returned `next_action: "wait_for_human_approval"`):
  Call `request_approval`, show waiting message, stop. Resume only after `/bk-approve`.
- **Gate step**: Wait for user response via AskUserQuestion.
- **Other action step pausing without HITL**: "Type `/bk-next` to proceed."

## Completion Message

<HARD-RULE>
When the workflow finishes, call `complete_task` with a non-empty `summary`.
The summary must include decisions made, artifact paths, and suggested next actions, formatted in Markdown.
</HARD-RULE>

```
complete_task(task_id=N, status="completed", summary="## Decisions\n- Goal: ...\n- Approach: ...\n\n## Artifacts\n- Design doc: `docs/specs/...`\n\n## Next Steps\nStart implementation from Phase 1.")
```

Show completion message to user:

```
🎉 Workflow complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Summary
[key decisions table]

## Artifacts
- 📄 Design doc: `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-xxx-design.md`

## Next Steps
Start implementation from Phase 1.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## output Format

<HARD-RULE>
All output must be at least 200 characters. Do not send one-line summaries only.
Always use ## heading structure.
Write in past-tense declarative form ("I analyzed...", "I generated...").
Include absolute paths for any files created.
</HARD-RULE>

## Web UI State Synchronization

<HARD-RULE>
Check every `heartbeat` / `execute_step` / `advance(peek=true)` response for these three signals — the web UI can mutate task state at any time.

**1. `cancelled: true`** (heartbeat or `advance(peek=true)` returning `status: "cancelled"`)
Stop all execution immediately. Make no further `complete_task` / `execute_step` / `advance` calls. Tell the user:

> ⚠️ 태스크가 웹 UI에서 중지되었습니다. Task #{id} — Step {N}에서 사용자에 의해 중단되었습니다. 다시 시작하려면 `/bk-next`로 재개하거나 `/bk-start`로 새 워크플로를 시작하세요.

**2. `rewound: true` or HTTP 409 `error_code: "STEP_REWOUND"`**
Stop executing the current step, call `advance(task_id, peek=true)` for the new current step, then re-execute from there. The new step's `log_status` will be `"pending"` — treat it normally. Tell the user:

> 🔄 웹 UI에서 되감기가 실행되었습니다. Step {new_step}부터 재개합니다.

**3. `log_status: "cancelled"` while `status: "running"`** (on `advance(peek=true)` at the start of a step loop)
The step was reset by a rewind. Re-execute from scratch — this is not a terminal error.

**Polling cadence**: call `heartbeat` at least every 30 seconds during long-running steps and always inspect the response. At the start of each new step, verify `advance(peek=true)` reflects the expected step — if `current_step` disagrees with what you expected, the server's value is authoritative.
</HARD-RULE>

## Comment Check

If comments are present, notify the user before executing and ask how to handle them via AskUserQuestion.

## Failure Handling

Ask via AskUserQuestion: Skip / Retry / Previous step / Abort.
