# Watermelon Workflow Start

Select a registered workflow, create a task, and immediately execute the first step.

## Argument Handling

Parse the argument string with this precedence (first match wins):

| Pattern                                     | Meaning                            | Action                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| _(none)_                                    | No argument                        | Fetch workflow list, ask user to select via AskUserQuestion. Also run Session Restore first.     |
| `#<taskID>` (starts with `#`, rest numeric) | Resume a specific task             | Skip workflow selection, jump straight to `advance(task_id=N, peek=true)` and continue that task |
| `<digits>` only                             | Workflow numeric ID                | Skip the list UI, call `start_workflow(workflow_id=N)` directly                                  |
| `<name> :: <prompt>`                        | Workflow name/ID + initial context | Match workflow by name or ID, pass everything after `::` as `context`                            |
| `<name>`                                    | Workflow name match                | Fuzzy-match the workflow list, propose the best match as Recommended                             |

The `::` separator can combine with `#<taskID>` or `<ID>` forms too (e.g. `/bk-start 42 :: review PR #77`).

## Core Principles

- **Instructions are internal agent directives. Never expose raw instruction text to the user.**
- Never use system terms like "node", "node_type", "chain_nodes" with the user.
- Refer to steps as "step" only.
- All `output` written to the server must be in past-tense declarative form ("I analyzed...", "I generated...").

## AskUserQuestion Parameter Rules

- `options` must have 2–4 entries.
- `preview` is a plain string. Use `\n` for line breaks.
- `header` must be 12 characters or fewer.
- `multiSelect` must be `false`.

## Session Restore (Resume In-Progress or Timed-Out Task)

<HARD-RULE>
Follow all steps in order before proceeding to workflow selection.

### Step A — Mark zombie tasks

Call the `sweep_stale_tasks` MCP tool (defaults to `timeout_minutes=120`). This converts any `running` tasks idle for over 2 hours to `timed_out` so they can be surfaced for resume/cleanup in Step B.

### Step B — Fetch existing tasks

Call `list_tasks` with `status=running` and again with `status=timed_out`.
Collect all results into a combined candidate list sorted by `updated_at` descending (most recent first).

If the list is empty → skip to workflow selection.

### Step C — Build the task summary

For each candidate, compute age from `updated_at` to now.
Format: `"Task #{id} — {workflow_name} (Step {current_step}/{total_steps}, {age}전)"`

Example output:

```
미완료 태스크 2건이 있습니다:
① Task #31 — 코드 리뷰 워크플로 (Step 3/6, 3시간 전) [timed_out]
② Task #28 — 보안 점검 (Step 1/4, 30분 전) [running]
```

### Step D — Ask what to do

**Case 1: exactly 1 candidate**

Ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "미완료 태스크"
- preview: `"Task #{id} — {workflow_name}\nStep {N}/{total} · {age}전 중단"`
- options (pick the most appropriate 3–4):
  - `"이어서 진행"` — resume this task
  - `"종료하고 새로 시작"` — close this task then start fresh
  - `"닫지 않고 새로 시작"` — leave as-is, open a new task
  - _(only if status=running)_ `"계속 실행 중"` — another agent is handling it, do nothing

**Case 2: 2 or more candidates**

Ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "미완료 태스크"
- preview: the task summary list built above
- options:
  - `"가장 최근 태스크 이어서"` — resume the most recent one
  - `"모두 종료하고 새로 시작"` — close all candidates, then start fresh
  - `"새 태스크 시작 (기존 유지)"` — leave existing as-is, open a new task

### Step E — Execute the choice

**"이어서 진행" / "가장 최근 태스크 이어서"**:
Call `advance(task_id, peek=true)`, read `task_context`, then continue with the auto-advance loop.

**"종료하고 새로 시작" / "모두 종료하고 새로 시작"**:
For each task to close, call `complete_task(task_id, summary="사용자 요청으로 종료됨")`.
Confirm: "기존 태스크를 종료했습니다. 새 워크플로를 선택하세요." → proceed to workflow selection.

**"닫지 않고 새로 시작" / "새 태스크 시작 (기존 유지)"**:
Proceed to workflow selection without touching existing tasks.
</HARD-RULE>

## execute_step Parameters

When calling `execute_step`:

**Always provide**:

- `context_snapshot` (object): decisions made, key findings, next-step hints. The only reliable way to carry state across steps.
- `model_id` (string): current LLM model (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`). Read from your system prompt.

**Provide when known**:

- `user_name` (string)
- `session_id`, `agent_id` (strings): optional identifiers, server stores them for audit.

**Do NOT send manually**: `provider_slug` — the MCP server injects it from the connection handshake.

**Record file/commit outputs** in the `artifacts` array on the same call:

- File created: `{artifact_type: "file", title: "Design Doc", file_path: "docs/specs/design.md"}`
- Git commit: `{artifact_type: "git_commit", title: "Implementation", git_ref: "<hash>"}`
- URL: `{artifact_type: "url", title: "PR", url: "https://..."}`

## Session Metadata

When calling `start_workflow`, pass a `session_meta` JSON string carrying project context the server can't otherwise see. The MCP server auto-fills `provider_slug` from the client handshake, so you only need to supply what the agent knows:

```json
{
  "project_dir": "/Users/dante/workspace/project",
  "user_name": "dante",
  "model_id": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "git_remote": "git@github.com:user/repo.git",
  "git_branch": "main",
  "os": "Darwin arm64",
  "started_at": "<current UTC ISO timestamp>"
}
```

Collect `git_remote` / `git_branch` / `os` via short shell calls (`git remote get-url origin`, `git branch --show-current`, `uname -s -m`). `model_id` comes from your system prompt; `user_name` from `whoami` if unknown; `started_at` is the current UTC time. **Do not walk the process tree to guess the agent name** — the MCP handshake tells the server which client is connected.

## Credential Handling (API Service Nodes)

If the `advance` response includes a `credentials` field, the node requires external API integration.

<HARD-RULE>
Use key-value pairs from `credentials.secrets` to make API calls.
Example: `credentials.secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN` → `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"`
Never include raw secret values (tokens, keys) in `execute_step` output.
Record only results (URL, status code, response summary).
</HARD-RULE>

## Execution Steps

### 1. Fetch and Select Workflow

Call `list_workflows` to retrieve the list.

**No workflows exist**: Ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "No workflows"
- "No workflows found. Would you like to create one now?"
- options: "Create new workflow" / "Cancel"

If "Create new workflow" → immediately invoke the `bk-design` skill. Pass the user's original argument (if any) as the goal so `bk-design` can pre-fill the design step. After `bk-design` completes and the workflow is registered, return here and proceed with Step 2 using the newly created workflow.

**Single workflow**: Skip the selection UI, just confirm:

- "Start the '{title}' workflow?" (AskUserQuestion: "Start" / "Cancel")

**Multiple workflows**: Show selection via AskUserQuestion.

If the user selects "Create new workflow" from the selection UI → invoke `bk-design`, then continue as above.

### 2. Create Task + Open Monitoring Page

Call `start_workflow`. Pass any argument as `context`.

Derive a short `title` (≤60 chars) from the user's goal and pass it alongside `context`. If the argument is already short, use it; otherwise distill it to a noun phrase (e.g. "Hermes AI 아티클 생성", not the full paragraph). The raw prompt becomes `context`; only the short label goes into `title`.

After `start_workflow` returns the `task_id`, open the monitoring page in the user's browser (`open "${WEBUI_URL}/tasks/${TASK_ID}"` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux — `WEBUI_URL` is the `webui_url` field in the response).

### 3. Execute First Step + Auto-Advance Loop

Read the first step's instruction as an **internal directive and execute immediately**.

After execution, save with `execute_step`, then check the response for `next_action` before calling `advance`.

**Show roadmap at start** (#20):

```
Starting: {workflow title} ({n} steps)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**1** → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📺 Live: ${WEBUI_URL}/tasks/${TASK_ID}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Auto-advance loop**: if `execute_step` returns no `next_action`, proceed to the next step automatically. Show a brief inline update (`✅ [{title}] done → continuing to next step…`). Repeat until a gate step or `hitl=true` action step is reached — do not pause to ask the user to type `/bk-next`.

### 4. When Pausing

Check the `next_action` field in the `execute_step` response and handle accordingly:

#### HITL (next_action: "wait_for_human_approval")

Call `request_approval`, then immediately show the HITL approval AskUserQuestion (inline HITL approval). Do NOT stop and tell the user to type `/bk-approve`.

#### Gate step (no next_action, node_type=gate)

Write VS content text (titles, descriptions, option labels) in the user's language. The frame UI (Submit button, status) is auto-localized; only agent-authored content needs matching locale.

- If `visual_selection: true`:
  1. Compose a VS content **fragment** (inner HTML only — no `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>`, the frame is injected automatically). Component classes: `bk-options`, `bk-cards`, `bk-checklist`, `bk-code-compare` (selection); `bk-slider`, `bk-input`, `bk-textarea`, `bk-ranking`, `bk-matrix` (input); `bk-split`, `bk-pros-cons`, `bk-mockup`, `bk-timeline` (display).

     **Required attributes** (server validates these):
     - Selection items (`.bk-option`, `.bk-card`, `.bk-check-item`, `.bk-code-option`): `data-value="<id>"` on each item. Optional `data-recommended` on the suggested choice.
     - Input components: `data-name="<id>"` for keying the response. `bk-slider` also needs `data-min`, `data-max`, `data-value`, optional `data-unit`. `bk-input`/`bk-textarea` accept `data-label`, `data-placeholder`, optional `data-required` and `data-response-key="comment"` (stores into top-level `comment`).
     - Per-item memo: add `data-requires-comment` to force a memo before submit. Optional `data-comment-name="<key>"` stores it into `response.fields[<key>]`.
     - Optional first line: `<!-- @bk size=sm|md|lg|xl|full -->` (default `sm`).

     **Full catalog with template patterns and per-component examples: see `bk-design § VS Component Selection Guide`.**

     Minimal example:

     ```html
     <h2>Choose an approach</h2>
     <div class="bk-options">
       <div class="bk-option" data-value="monolith" data-recommended>
         <div class="bk-option-letter">A</div>
         <div class="bk-option-body">
           <h3>Monolith</h3>
           <p>Simple deployment</p>
         </div>
       </div>
       <div class="bk-option" data-value="microservices">
         <div class="bk-option-letter">B</div>
         <div class="bk-option-body">
           <h3>Microservices</h3>
           <p>Independent scaling</p>
         </div>
       </div>
     </div>
     ```

  2. Call `set_visual_html(task_id, node_id, html)` with the fragment.
  3. Open the VS deep link so the user sees the selection UI immediately:
     ```bash
     open "${WEBUI_URL}/tasks/${TASK_ID}?step=${STEP_ORDER}&vs=true"
     ```
  4. Poll `get_web_response(task_id)` every 3-5 seconds until a response arrives (max 120 seconds).
  5. The response is a **JSON object** (not a plain string). Parse it to read the user's choices and feedback:

     ```json
     {
       "selections": ["monolith"],
       "values": { "budget": 70 },
       "ranking": ["security", "ux"],
       "comment": "Keep this direction but tighten rollout scope",
       "fields": { "change_request": "Add a rollback plan" },
       "option_comments": {
         "monolith": "Prefer this if we can phase deployment"
       }
     }
     ```

     - `selections`: chosen option values (from bk-options, bk-cards, bk-checklist, bk-code-compare)
     - `values`: numeric inputs (from bk-slider, keyed by data-name)
     - `ranking`: ordered list (from bk-ranking)
     - `matrix`: placement coordinates (from bk-matrix)
     - `comment`: free-form global memo from bk-textarea/bk-input with `data-response-key="comment"` (or `data-name="comment"`)
     - `fields`: named text inputs from bk-input / bk-textarea, plus any option-level memo stored via `data-comment-name`
     - `option_comments`: per-option free-text notes attached to selected choices
       Only populated fields appear.

  6. When forming the gate answer, never ignore free-text feedback:
     - If `comment` exists, summarize it in the gate output.
     - If `fields.change_request` or similar named fields exist, treat them as authoritative revision instructions.
     - If `option_comments` exists, preserve the mapping between the selected option and its note.
     - A response like "select B + add changes" must not be collapsed into just `"selections": ["b"]`.

  7. Use the parsed response to form the gate answer and call `advance`.

- If `visual_selection: false` → present the gate question to the user via AskUserQuestion. Use the response as gate answer, call `execute_step` with the answer, then `advance`.

#### Attachments

<HARD-RULE>
When `advance` returns `node.attachments`:
1. Review the list (filename, mime_type, size_bytes)
2. Call `get_attachment(workflow_id, node_id, attachment_id)` for each text file the instruction references
3. Use downloaded content as context when executing the instruction
4. For binary files, note their existence but do not download unless explicitly required
</HARD-RULE>

#### Loop (next_action: "loop_back")

<HARD-RULE>
Loop nodes repeat until a termination condition is met. The instruction contains the termination condition.

**Execution flow:**

1. Read the instruction and execute one iteration (e.g., ask one clarifying question).
2. Present the result/question to the user via AskUserQuestion.
3. Based on user response, decide: is the termination condition met?
   - **NOT met** → call `execute_step(loop_continue=true)` → server creates a new pending log on the same node → re-execute the loop step (go back to step 1)
   - **Met** → call `execute_step(loop_continue=false)` → loop ends → call `advance` to move to next step

**Example — "Clarifying Questions" loop (loop_back_to=self):**

```
Iteration 1: "Who is the primary user of this feature?" → user answers → purpose clear, constraints unclear → loop_continue=true
Iteration 2: "Are there tech stack limitations?" → user answers → constraints clear, success criteria unclear → loop_continue=true
Iteration 3: "What defines completion?" → user answers → all items clear → loop_continue=false → advance
```

**Example — "Design Section Presentation" loop:**

```
Iteration 1: Present architecture section → user "looks good" → more sections remain → loop_continue=true
Iteration 2: Present data flow section → user "needs revision" → revise and re-present → loop_continue=true
Iteration 3: Present final section → user approves → all sections done → loop_continue=false → advance
```

</HARD-RULE>

#### Loop + VS History Pattern

When a loop node uses `visual_selection: true`, each iteration presents a VS screen and collects a response. Use `get_web_response(task_id, node_id)` to access all previous iteration responses for that node:

```json
{
  "task_id": 19,
  "node_id": 109,
  "history": [
    {
      "iteration": 1,
      "web_response": { "selections": ["a"] },
      "created_at": "..."
    },
    {
      "iteration": 2,
      "web_response": {
        "selections": ["b"],
        "values": { "confidence": 80 },
        "fields": { "change_request": "Need more detail on error handling" }
      },
      "created_at": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the history to adapt subsequent VS screens - for example, pre-selecting the user's previous choice, adjusting slider defaults based on past values, carrying forward `fields.change_request` into the next revision prompt, or skipping already-confirmed items.

## Web UI State Synchronization (웹 UI 상태 동기화)

<HARD-RULE>
The web UI can change task/step state at any time. You MUST check every heartbeat and execute_step response for the following signals and react immediately:

### 1. Task cancelled — `cancelled: true`

Triggered by: `heartbeat` response OR `advance(peek=true)` returning `status: "cancelled"`

Action:

- Stop all execution immediately. Make no further MCP calls.
- Notify the user:
  ```
  ⚠️ 태스크가 웹 UI에서 중지되었습니다.
  Task #{id} — Step {N}에서 사용자에 의해 중단되었습니다.
  다시 시작하려면 /bk-start를 실행하세요.
  ```
- Do NOT call `complete_task`, `execute_step`, or `advance`.

### 2. Step rewound — `rewound: true` or error code `STEP_REWOUND`

Triggered by:

- `heartbeat` response contains `rewound: true` (web UI rewound while step was running)
- `execute_step` returns HTTP 409 with `error_code: "STEP_REWOUND"` (tried to save a cancelled step)

Action:

- Stop executing the current step immediately.
- Call `advance(task_id, peek=true)` to get the new current step.
- Notify the user briefly:
  ```
  🔄 웹 UI에서 되감기가 실행되었습니다. Step {new_step}부터 재개합니다.
  ```
- Re-execute from the new current step as if it was just assigned.
- The new step's `log_status` will be `"pending"` — treat it normally.

### 3. Step log cancelled but task still running — `log_status: "cancelled"` + `status: "running"`

Triggered by: `advance(peek=true)` at the start of a step loop

This means the step was reset by a rewind. Action:

- Re-execute this step from scratch. Do not skip it.
- Do not treat this as a terminal error.

### Polling cadence

- Call `heartbeat` at least every 30 seconds during long-running steps.
- Always check the response — never fire-and-forget heartbeats.
- At the start of each new step (before executing), verify `advance(peek=true)` reflects the expected step. If `current_step` differs from what you expected, follow the server's value.
  </HARD-RULE>

## Graceful Interruption

**Trigger phrases**: stop, pause, cancel, abort, hold on, 잠깐, 중단, 그만, 멈춰, 정지, Ctrl+C. Treat any of these mid-workflow as a request to interrupt — do not silently abort, follow this prompt.

When the user explicitly asks to stop mid-workflow, ask how to handle it:

- **Pause (resume later)** — save a brief `context_snapshot` via `execute_step` so state is preserved, leave task as `running`. The server will auto-`timed_out` after 2 hours; `/bk-start` can resume it.
- **Cancel** — call `cancel_task(task_id, reason)`. Task is marked `cancelled`; no further `execute_step`/`advance` calls.
- **Keep going** — dismiss the prompt and continue the current step.

Skip this prompt if all steps are already complete and you're about to call `complete_task` anyway — the workflow is finishing naturally, not being interrupted.

## Feedback Survey (before calling complete_task)

When the workflow finishes, run the feedback survey flow.
Follow the sequence: `save_feedback` → `complete_task` → suggest improvements.
