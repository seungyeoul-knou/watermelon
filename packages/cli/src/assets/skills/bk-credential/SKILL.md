# Watermelon Credential Management

Securely manage external service credentials (API keys, tokens) on the Watermelon server.

## Argument Handling

- `/bk-credential` → Show action selection menu.
- `/bk-credential add <service name>` → Start the add credential flow.
- `/bk-credential list` → Show registered credentials list.

## Security Principles

<HARD-RULE>
- Never print credential secret values to the user.
- When editing, never display existing secrets. Accept new values and replace entirely.
</HARD-RULE>

Credentials are scoped to the caller only by default. To share with a group,
use the credential shares API or the credential management UI — credentials
are no longer organised into folders.

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Select Action

If no argument, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Credentials"
- options: ["List", "Add new", "Edit", "Delete"]

---

### Action: List

Call `list_credentials` and display results:

```
Registered Credentials
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ID  Service Name      Description
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1   openai            OpenAI API
2   github            GitHub PAT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2 total
```

---

### Action: Add New

**Service name**: Ask via AskUserQuestion.

**Duplicate check**: Call `list_credentials` and look for any existing entry with the same `service_name` (case-insensitive). The server doesn't enforce uniqueness, so duplicates are technically allowed but make later `credential_id` selection ambiguous (e.g. when `bk-instruction` binds a credential by service name). If a duplicate exists, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Duplicate"
- "A credential named '<service_name>' already exists (ID: <existing id>). Continue?"
- options: ["Use a different name", "Update the existing one (switch to Edit)", "Create anyway (allow duplicate)"]

**Secrets input**: Ask the user for key-value pairs:

```
Enter the credentials for <service name>.
Format: KEY=VALUE (one per line)
Example:
  API_KEY=sk-xxxx
  BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Parse the input to build the secrets object.

**Description** (optional): Accept a short description.

**Confirm**: Ask via AskUserQuestion before registering:

- header: "Confirm"
- "Service: <service_name>\nKeys: <key list (values masked)>\nRegister?"
- options: ["Register", "Cancel"]

Call `create_credential`:

```json
{
  "service_name": "<service name>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "secrets": { "KEY": "value", ... }
}
```

---

### Action: Edit

Call `list_credentials`, then ask which one to edit via AskUserQuestion.

Ask what to change (AskUserQuestion):

- options: ["Change service name", "Change description", "Replace secrets", "Cancel"]

For "Replace secrets" → accept all new key-value pairs and replace entirely.

Call `update_credential`:

```json
{
  "credential_id": <id>,
  "service_name": "<if changed>",
  "description": "<if changed>",
  "secrets": { ... }
}
```

---

### Action: Delete

Call `list_credentials`, then ask which one to delete via AskUserQuestion.

Confirm via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Confirm delete"
- "Delete the '<service_name>' credential? This will fail if any workflow node references it."
- options: ["Delete", "Cancel"]

Call `delete_credential`. On 409 error (in use), inform the user which workflow is using it.

---

## Linking to Workflows

Credentials are linked to workflow nodes via `credential_id`.

When designing workflows (`/bk-design`, `/bk-improve`), set the credential on the node that calls an external API:

```json
{
  "title": "Call External API",
  "credential_id": <credential id>
}
```

Watermelon automatically injects the secrets into that node at runtime.
