# Watermelon Task Status

View the progress of active and completed tasks.

## Argument Handling

- `/bk-status` → Show all running tasks. If none, show recent completed tasks.
- `/bk-status <task_id>` → Show detailed step-by-step log for that task.
- `/bk-status running` → Show only running tasks.
- `/bk-status completed` → Show only completed tasks.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Fetch Tasks

Call `list_tasks` with optional filters:

- No argument: `list_tasks()` (all tasks) or `list_tasks(status="running")`
- With status filter: `list_tasks(status="running")` or `list_tasks(status="completed")`
- With task_id: `advance(task_id=<id>, peek=true)` for detailed view

### 2. Display Task List

```

```

### 3. Detailed View

If a task number is given, call `advance(task_id=<id>, peek=true)` and show the step-by-step log:

```

```

### 4. Offer Actions

After displaying, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Actions"
- options: ["Resume active task (/bk-start)", "View detailed task", "Done"]

## Notes

- `list_tasks` respects RBAC — only tasks on workflows the user can read are returned.
- For real-time monitoring, use the web UI: http://localhost:3000/tasks
