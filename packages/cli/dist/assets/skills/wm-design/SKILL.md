# Watermelon Workflow Design

Design a structured workflow from a natural language goal and register it on the Watermelon server.

**Which creation skill to use?**

- **`/wm-design`** (this one) — start from a natural-language goal, design the node structure from scratch.
- **`/wm-import`** — the user already has an external resource (GitHub repo, URL, local skill, pasted text) to convert into a workflow.
- **`/wm-improve`** — there's already a registered workflow that needs a better version.

## Argument Handling

- `/wm-design` → Ask for the goal via AskUserQuestion.
- `/wm-design <goal>` → Start designing from the provided goal.

## Core Principles

- One node = **one agent action**. Split overly large chunks.
- `node_type: "action"` = regular agent step; auto-advances unless `hitl: true`.
- `node_type: "gate"` = user decision point; always pauses for human approval.
- `node_type: "loop"` = repeating step; set `loop_back_to` to the target step order.
- `hitl: true` = action node that requires explicit human approval before advancing. Default: `false`.
- `visual_selection: true` = gate node where the agent renders an HTML UI and the user makes a selection by clicking (instead of typing). Only valid on `gate` nodes. Default: `false`.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

Extract the goal from arguments. If none, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "What to build?"
- "What task would you like to automate? Please describe in detail."
- options: ["Competitor analysis", "Code review", "Report generation", "Type my own"]

If "Type my own" → accept free-text goal input.

### Step 2: Check for Existing Workflows

Call `list_workflows` to check for similar existing workflows.

If a similar one is found, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Existing workflow"
- "'{title}' already exists. Create a new one or improve the existing one?"
- options: ["Create new", "Improve existing (switch to /wm-improve)"]

If "Improve existing" → switch to `/wm-improve` flow.

### Step 3: Select Folder

Call `list_folders` to get the folder list.

Ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Save location"
- "Which folder should this be saved in?"
- options: folder name list (up to 4) + "My Workspace (default)"

### Step 4: Design Workflow Structure

Analyze the goal and design the nodes. **Every node instruction must satisfy the Instruction Depth Standard below before proceeding to Step 5.**

**Node structure example:**

```json
{
  "title": "Clarify Goal",
  "instruction": "## Goal Clarification\n\nExtract precise requirements before any work begins:\n\n1. Read the user's stated goal word by word and list every ambiguity.\n2. For each ambiguity, formulate one closed-ended question (yes/no or multiple choice).\n3. Ask the questions one at a time — never batch them.\n\n**Output**: A numbered list of confirmed constraints and success criteria.\n**Verification**: Every ambiguity is resolved; no open questions remain.",
  "node_type": "action",
  "hitl": false,
  "order": 1
}
```

Show the design to the user:

```
Designed workflow: <title>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [Clarify Goal]     action
2. [Collect Data]     action
3. [Run Analysis]     action
4. [Review Results]   gate ← pauses for human approval
5. [Generate Report]  action
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5 steps total
```

Ask via AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Confirm"
- "Create the workflow with this structure?"
- options: ["Create", "Edit", "Cancel"]

If "Edit" → accept modification input and redesign.

### Step 5: Register Workflow

Call `create_workflow`:

```json
{
  "title": "<workflow title>",
  "description": "<goal summary>",
  "version": "1.0",
  "folder_id": <selected folder id>,
  "nodes": [...]
}
```

<HARD-RULE>
Immediately validate the `create_workflow` result before doing anything else:

- If the response includes `node_verification`, require `node_verification.mismatch === false`.
- If `nodes` were supplied to `create_workflow`, treat that call as the only allowed initial node creation step.
- Never append the same planned nodes after `create_workflow(nodes=[...])` because an older server response showed `data.nodes=[]`.
- If verification fails, STOP and investigate. Do not continue with `append_node` or `insert_node`.
  </HARD-RULE>

### Step 6: Report Result + Open in Browser

On success, open the workflow detail page in the browser:

```bash
open "${WEBUI_URL}/workflows/${WORKFLOW_ID}"
```

`WEBUI_URL` = the `webui_url` field returned by `create_workflow`.

Then display:

```
✅ Workflow registered
Name: <title> (ID: <id>)
Steps: <n>
Version: 1.0
🔗 ${WEBUI_URL}/workflows/${WORKFLOW_ID}

Type `/wm-run` to execute it now.
```

## Node Type Reference

### action — Auto-executing agent step

- `auto_advance=1` (automatic). The agent executes the instruction, saves the result, and automatically proceeds to the next step.
- Set `hitl: true` to require human approval after execution. Use only for security-sensitive or irreversible operations.

### gate — User decision point

- `auto_advance=0`. Must receive a user response before proceeding.
- Set `visual_selection: true` to have the agent render an HTML UI where the user selects by clicking.
- Used for final result review, direction choices, approval/rejection, etc.

### loop — Conditional repetition

- `auto_advance=0`. Repeats the same step until the termination condition is met.
- `loop_back_to`: target step_order to loop back to. Usually points to itself (self-loop).
- **The instruction MUST include a clear termination condition** so the agent can decide `loop_continue=true/false`.

**Loop node design patterns:**

```json
{
  "title": "Clarifying Questions",
  "node_type": "loop",
  "loop_back_to": 4,
  "instruction": "Ask one question at a time. Use multiple choice when possible.\n\nGather:\n- Purpose: What problem does this feature solve?\n- Constraints: Tech stack, performance, security limitations?\n- Success criteria: What defines completion?\n\nTermination: End when purpose, scope, constraints, and success criteria are all clear."
}
```

```json
{
  "title": "Design Section Presentation",
  "node_type": "loop",
  "loop_back_to": 7,
  "instruction": "Present the design section by section.\nEach section scales with complexity: a few sentences if simple, 200-300 words if nuanced.\nCover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing.\nAfter each section, ask the user for confirmation.\n\nTermination: End when all design sections have been approved by the user."
}
```

**When to use loop nodes:**

- Information gathering (question → answer repetition)
- Section-by-section presentation/review (present → approve repetition)
- Iterative refinement (result → feedback → revision repetition)

## Node Design Guidelines

- 3–7 steps is ideal. Consider splitting if more than 10.
- Use `node_type: "gate"` before the final step to let the user review results.
- Use `node_type: "loop"` when a step needs iterative user interaction. Always include a clear termination condition in the instruction.
- Use `hitl: true` on `action` nodes only when the step requires explicit human judgment mid-flow (e.g., security-sensitive operations, irreversible actions).
- Use `visual_selection: true` on `gate` nodes when the selection is best expressed visually — e.g., choosing a layout, picking a chart type, selecting a UI template. The agent must call `set_visual_html` with interactive HTML before executing the step; the user's click supplies the response.
- For nodes requiring external API calls, specify `credential_id`. Create credentials first with `/wm-credential`.

## Instruction Depth Standard

<HARD-RULE>
Before calling `create_workflow`, verify every node instruction satisfies ALL of the following:

1. **Role/context** (first line or heading): who or what performs this step — e.g., "## Market Analyst", "You are acting as a senior code reviewer"
2. **Numbered sub-steps**: at minimum 2 explicit steps describing HOW to perform the action, not just WHAT to produce
3. **Output specification**: exactly what is produced — file path + format, structured data shape, or required fields
4. **Verification**: one line stating how to confirm the step succeeded
5. **Loop nodes only**: termination condition as the final line — "Termination: end when X"

**Minimum instruction length: 80 words.** If an instruction is shorter, it is not specific enough — expand it.
</HARD-RULE>

### Anti-patterns → Prescriptive Rewrites

| ❌ Vague — do not write    | ✅ Prescriptive — write this instead                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Analyze the data."        | "Read the CSV at `data/input.csv`. Compute row count, null counts per column, and value distributions for numeric columns. Output a summary table to `data/eda-summary.md`."                   |
| "Review the results."      | "Check each output against the success criteria from Step 1. Build a pass/fail table with one evidence line per criterion. Flag any criterion below threshold in red."                         |
| "Ask the user what to do." | "Present exactly 3 options via bk-options (sm): A) proceed as-is, B) revise the output, C) abort. Include a one-sentence consequence for each option."                                         |
| "Generate a report."       | "Create `docs/report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with sections: Executive Summary (3 bullets), Findings (numbered, each with evidence), Recommendations (priority-ordered), Next Steps (owner + deadline)." |
| "Search the web."          | "Run a web search for each of the 3 queries listed. For each result, record: source URL, publication date, key claim (1 sentence). Discard results older than 12 months."                      |

### Instruction Templates by Node Type

**action — data / research step:**

```
## <Expert Role>

<One sentence: what this step accomplishes and why it matters here.>

1. <First concrete action — tool call, file read, calculation>
2. <Second concrete action — transformation, filtering, aggregation>
3. <Third action if needed>

**Output**: <Exact file path or data structure>
**Verification**: <Command or check that confirms success>
```

**gate — user decision:**

```
<Brief context: what was just produced and what the user must decide.>

Present options using bk-options (size=sm):
- A) <Option> — <one-sentence consequence>
- B) <Option> — <one-sentence consequence>
- C) <Option> — <one-sentence consequence>

Mark the recommended option with `data-recommended`.
```

**loop — iterative interaction:**

```
## <Role>

<What is being iterated and why iteration is needed.>

Each iteration:
1. <What to present or ask>
2. <How to process the response>
3. <How to update state>

**Termination**: End when <specific, measurable condition>.
```

#### VS Component Selection Guide

When designing a `visual_selection: true` gate node, specify which `bk-*` components the agent should use in the node instruction. This keeps VS screens consistent and prevents vague "make a selection UI" instructions.

<HARD-RULE>
- VS content shown to the user must be written in the user's language.
- Labels, option descriptions, helper text, slider units, ranking item names, and matrix axis labels must all follow the user's language.
- Keep component class names and JSON keys in their canonical English forms (`bk-options`, `selections`, `values`, `ranking`, `matrix`, `comment`, `fields`, `option_comments`).
</HARD-RULE>

**Dialog size directive** — optional first line of the HTML: `<!-- @bk size=sm|md|lg|xl|full -->`. Default is `sm` (single-column choices). Step up to `md` (cards, code-compare), `lg` (pros-cons, ranking, timeline), `xl` (mockups, matrix, side-by-side wireframes), or `full` (dashboard previews, complex layouts) whenever content benefits from horizontal space.

**Component → Use Case mapping:**

| Component         | Recommended size | Best for                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bk-options`      | `sm`             | Mutually exclusive choices with descriptions (A/B/C decisions) |
| `bk-cards`        | `md`             | Visual previews (layout, chart type, UI template selection)    |
| `bk-checklist`    | `sm`             | Feature toggles, multi-select from a list                      |
| `bk-code-compare` | `lg`             | Comparing code approaches side by side                         |
| `bk-slider`       | `sm`             | Budget allocation, confidence levels, thresholds               |
| `bk-input`        | `sm`             | Short rationale, constraint, owner, or one-line change request |
| `bk-textarea`     | `sm` or `md`     | Long-form feedback, revision request, reviewer memo            |
| `bk-ranking`      | `md`             | Priority ordering (requirements, features)                     |
| `bk-matrix`       | `xl`             | Urgency/importance mapping, risk assessment                    |
| `bk-split`        | `xl`             | Two-option comparison (A vs B)                                 |
| `bk-pros-cons`    | `lg`             | Pros and cons review                                           |
| `bk-mockup`       | `xl` or `full`   | UI wireframe / layout previews                                 |
| `bk-timeline`     | `lg`             | Roadmap / milestone review                                     |

**Instruction template patterns:**

```text
Present the alternatives using bk-options with data-recommended on the suggested choice.
(dialog: sm — default, no directive needed)
```

```text
Show the layout candidates using bk-cards (size=md), then add a bk-slider named "confidence" (0-100, unit "%").
Start the HTML with: <!-- @bk size=md -->
```

```text
If the user may want to approve with edits, add a bk-textarea with data-name="comment" and data-response-key="comment" so they can leave a global memo.
```

```text
If a specific option requires justification or revision notes, add data-requires-comment to that selectable item.
Use data-comment-name="change_request" when the memo should be persisted into response.fields.change_request.
```

**Feedback-friendly gate design rules:**

- For review/approval gates, default to **selection + memo**, not selection alone.
- If one option means "approve with edits", make that option require a comment.
- Use `bk-input` for short structured constraints (owner, budget cap, deadline).
- Use `bk-textarea` for open-ended revision requests or free-form reviewer notes.
- When designing downstream steps, explicitly instruct the agent to parse and honor `comment`, `fields`, and `option_comments`, not just `selections`.

```text
Collect optional capabilities with bk-checklist and ask the user to rank the top three priorities using bk-ranking.
(dialog: sm or md — omit directive or use <!-- @bk size=md -->)
```

```text
Compare the two implementation approaches using bk-code-compare (size=lg), then capture risk posture in a bk-matrix (size=xl).
If both appear on the same screen, use the larger size: <!-- @bk size=xl -->
```

```text
Show a UI wireframe mockup or dashboard layout preview using bk-mockup with inline styles.
Start the HTML with: <!-- @bk size=xl --> or <!-- @bk size=full -->
Place two mockup cards side by side using display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr.
```

### Attachments

- Use node attachments for scripts, reference docs, prompts, and config files that the agent should load during execution.
- Add attachments only after the workflow and target node exist, using `upload_attachment(workflow_id, node_id, filename, content)`.
- Prefer text-based files so the execution skill can download and use their contents directly.
- Mention the attachment by filename in the node instruction when the agent is expected to read it.
- Keep attachments node-specific. Shared reusable logic belongs in an instruction template or a separate workflow step, not duplicated across many nodes.
- Use binary attachments only when necessary. Execution agents may only inspect their metadata unless the task explicitly requires the binary asset.

## Node Modification Strategy

<HARD-RULE>
- Before any structural edit, refresh the current workflow structure from the server and use the latest node ids / step orders as the source of truth.
- Update a single node → `update_node(workflow_id, node_id, ...only changed fields)`
- Append a node (at the end) → `append_node(workflow_id, title, instruction, node_type, loop_back_to?, visual_selection?)`
- Insert a node (in the middle) → `insert_node(workflow_id, after_step=N, title, instruction, node_type, loop_back_to?, visual_selection?)`
- Delete a node → `remove_node(workflow_id, node_id)`
- Never use `update_workflow(nodes=[...])` for full replacement unless a complete redesign is intended
- After every `append_node` or `insert_node`, inspect the returned `node_verification`.
- If `node_verification.mismatch === true`, STOP immediately and do not continue issuing more structural edits from the current plan snapshot.
</HARD-RULE>

## Inline vs Template Instructions

Nodes can have two types of instructions:

- **Template reference**: Node has `instruction_id` set. References a shared instruction template. Use `update_instruction` to modify the template — affects all nodes that reference it.
- **Inline instruction**: Node has no `instruction_id` and stores text directly in the `instruction` field. Use `update_node(workflow_id, node_id, instruction="new text")` to modify — affects only that node.

```
# Update inline instruction — affects only this node
update_node(workflow_id=67, node_id=109, instruction="new instruction text")

# Update instruction template — affects all referencing nodes
update_instruction(instruction_id=5, content="new template text")
```

## Folder & Workflow Organization

Triggered when the user says "move workflow", "change folder", "organize", or "create folder".

### Move an Existing Workflow to a Different Folder

1. Call `list_workflows` to identify the target workflow (or use the name the user mentioned).
2. Call `list_folders` to get the folder list.
3. Ask via AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "Move to"
   - "Which folder should '{workflow title}' be moved to?"
   - options: folder name list + "My Workspace (default)"
4. Call `move_workflow`:
   ```json
   { "workflow_id": <id>, "folder_id": <destination folder id> }
   ```
5. Report: `✅ Moved '{workflow title}' → '{folder name}'`

### Create a Standalone Folder

1. Ask for name and optional visibility (`personal` / `group` / `public`).
2. Call `create_folder`:
   ```json
   { "name": "<name>", "description": "<desc>", "visibility": "personal" }
   ```
3. Report: `✅ Folder '{name}' created.`

### Rename a Folder

Call `update_folder`:

```json
{ "folder_id": <id>, "name": "<new name>" }
```

### Delete an Empty Folder

Call `delete_folder`:

```json
{ "folder_id": <id> }
```

> Note: `delete_folder` fails with `FOLDER_NOT_EMPTY` if the folder contains any workflows, instructions, or sub-folders. Empty the folder first. Credentials are not filed in folders and do not affect this check.
